Spatial Data Science for Social Geography

Geography, maps particularly have been of interest since as long as I can remember so when this course delving into how to apply a Python Library called GeopandasðŸŒŽ to tell stories with a locational component, jumping in was exciting. As I continue through the coursework, I will add the notebooks to this repository an addition to a final project. The suggestion is to evaluate AirBnb density in Barcelona which sounds fun!
